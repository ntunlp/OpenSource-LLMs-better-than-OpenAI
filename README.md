### Datasets

#### Long-input capacity

1. [ZeroSCROLLS: A Zero-Shot Benchmark for Long Text Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14196). Uri Shaham et al, EMNLP 2023. Long-input benchmark containing 10 datasets: 2 summarization tasks ([GovReport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02112) and [SummScreenFD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07091)), 2 query-based summarization tasks ([QMSum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05938) and [SQuALITY](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11465)), 4 question-answering datasets ([Qasper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03011), [NarrativeQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07040), [QuALITY](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08608), [MuSiQue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00573)), 2 aggregation tasks ([SpaceDigest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04443), [BookSumSort](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08209)). 

#### Code

1. [Evaluating large models trained on code (**HumanEval** benchmark)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374). Mark Chen et al, 2021. 164 hand-written programming problems. Each problem includes a function signature, docstring, body, and several unit tests, with an average of 7.7 tests per problem.

#### Math

1. [Training verifiers to solve math word problems (**GSM8K** benchmark)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14168). Karl Cobbe et al, 2021. 8.5K (7.5k training + 1k test) high quality grade school math problems created by human problem writers. Each problem takes between 2 and 8 steps to solve, and solutions primarily involve performing a sequence of elementary calculations using basic arithmetic operations.
