### Evaluation Datasets

#### Question-answering (QA)

1. [**Natural Questions**: A Benchmark for Question Answering Research](https://aclanthology.org/Q19-1026/). Tom Kwiatkowski et al, TACL 2019. 307,373 training examples with single annotations; 7,830 development examples with 5-way annotations and 7,842 test examples with 5-way annotations. Questions are real anonymized, aggregated queries issued to the Google search engine. Each question is paired with an entire Wikipedia page. 
2. [**BoolQ**: Exploring the Surprising Difficulty of Natural Yes/No Questions](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1300/). Christopher Clark et al, NAACL 2019. 16,000 naturally occurring yes/no questions, split in 9.4k train, 3.2k dev, 3.2k test. Each question is paired with a Wikipedia passage. 
3. [**TruthfulQA**: Measuring How Models Mimic Human Falsehoods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07958). Stephanie Lin et al, ACL 2022. 817 questions spanning 38 categories. Question and answers are hand-written by human annotators and designed to elicit imitative falsehoods.

#### Long-input capacity

1. [**ZeroSCROLLS**: A Zero-Shot Benchmark for Long Text Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14196). Uri Shaham et al, EMNLP 2023. Long-input benchmark containing 10 datasets: 2 summarization tasks ([GovReport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02112) and [SummScreenFD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07091)), 2 query-based summarization tasks ([QMSum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05938) and [SQuALITY](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11465)), 4 question-answering datasets ([Qasper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03011), [NarrativeQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07040), [QuALITY](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08608), [MuSiQue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00573)), 2 aggregation tasks ([SpaceDigest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04443), [BookSumSort](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08209)). 

#### Code

1. [Evaluating Large Models Trained on Code (**HumanEval** benchmark)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374). Mark Chen et al, 2021. 164 hand-written programming problems. Each problem includes a function signature, docstring, body, and several unit tests, with an average of 7.7 tests per problem.

#### Math

1. [Training Verifiers to Solve Math Word Problems (**GSM8K** benchmark)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14168). Karl Cobbe et al, 2021. 8.5K (7.5k training + 1k test) high quality grade school math problems created by human problem writers. Each problem takes between 2 and 8 steps to solve, and solutions primarily involve performing a sequence of elementary calculations using basic arithmetic operations.

### High-performing open-source LLMs

#### Better pre-training techniques

|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Phi-1 [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11644)]  | June 20th, 2023   | From scratch     | 1.3B         | HumanEval   | GPT-3.5          | 47.0 pass@1 | 50.6 pass@1 |
| Llama-2-Long-Chat [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16039)]  | September 27th, 2023   | From scratch     | 1.3B         | HumanEval   | GPT-3.5          | 47.0 pass@1 | 50.6 pass@1 |

#### Better fine-tuning / instruction-tuning techniques

1. [**FIREACT**: Toward Language Agent Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05915). Chen et al., 2023. Training data was collected by prompting GPT-4. FireAct based on Llama-2-13b outperforms GPT-3.5 on HotpotQA.
2. [**AgentTuning**: Enabling Generalized Agent Abilities For LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.12823.pdf). Zeng et al., 2023. High quality trajectories generated by GPT-4 and veriried by human.
